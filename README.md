# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict insurance charges for individuals using a variety of features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. By leveraging regression models, this project explores how these factors influence the insurance charges and builds predictive models to estimate the cost of insurance for new individuals.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict insurance charges for individuals based on their personal and health-related information. The project focuses on:

Building and evaluating regression models.

Exploring the relationship between different features and insurance charges.

Understanding which factors have the most significant impact on insurance pricing.

## Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Pandas: Used for data preprocessing and manipulation.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and model performance.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression).

Jupyter Notebook: Environment used to document and run the code.
